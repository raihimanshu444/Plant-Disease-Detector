# Plant-Disease-Detector
This project is a Plant Disease Detection System that identifies diseases from leaf images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
It helps farmers and researchers detect diseases early and take preventive actions.

🚀 Features

Detects multiple plant diseases from leaf images

Built using Deep Learning (CNN)

Uses TensorFlow / Keras

Image preprocessing using OpenCV

User-friendly interface (Streamlit )

Easy-to-run & modular code structure
